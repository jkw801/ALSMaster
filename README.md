# ALSMaster
I am a master of ALS


Please change Alshistory.csv to ALSHistory_r.csv that I uploaded

Now, there are 5 scripts.
firstscript and first2script are for making a table for survival analysis and plotting K-M curves for 4 domains and death.
second~fourth script are just for adding variables. It is a boring course.
movement, swallowing, communicating, breathing, death script are for making survival models and validating the performances. 
allall script is for integrating 5 models' results and is ongoing.

I have made good models.
