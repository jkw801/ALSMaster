I am a master of ALS


Now, there are 5 scripts.
The order of scrips is "SurvivalTable", "Datacleaning", "Imputation", "Models", "Clustering".

"SurvivalTable" is for making a table for survival analysis and plotting K-M curves for 4 functional domains and death.

"Datacleaning" is for adding variables.

"Imputation" is for imputation.

"Models" is for making survival models and validating the performances. 

"Clustering" is for integrating 5 models' results and clustering patietns based on probability at 12 month in 5 domains
